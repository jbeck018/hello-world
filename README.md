Hellow World!
Jacob here, I am a Math nerd who is diving into the world of Python and Django while fiddling with a little bit of R and SQL along the way. Data Analytics, Data Science, and Backend Engineering are where I hope to be soon.
If you want to team up or have any advise, I am always open to new ideas.

Cheers!
